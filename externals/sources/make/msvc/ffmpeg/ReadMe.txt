To do MSVC build of FFMPEG library it is required to have Visual Studio 2012 or newer (tested with 2013 Express):
1) Run MSVC command prompt so proper environment is set.
2) From there run msys.bat to get into MSYS shell.
3) Run ./build to get both debug and release build. Or ./build-ffmpeg with release/debug/clean options.
