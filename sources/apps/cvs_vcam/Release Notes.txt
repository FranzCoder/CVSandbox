CVSandbox Virtual Camera 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------
03.08.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Instead of supporting single 640x480 resolution with 15 FPS rate, the virtual
  camera now supports number of different resolutions: 160x120, 320x240, 480x360,
  640x480, 800x600, 1200x900, 1280x720, 1800x1350, 1920x1080. All resolutions
  support frame rate from 1 to 30 frames a seconds, with default set to 30.
* Arbitrary size images are allowed to be pushed into the virtual camera
  (2000x1500 is the maximum though) - they will be resized automatically to the
  size requested by a client when starting the camera.
* In addition to the 32-bit build of the COM DLL, a 64-bit build is provided, so
  the virtual camera is available from 64-bit applications as well.
  Run provided "regsvr.bat" to register 64-bit version in the system.



CVSandbox Virtual Camera 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------
27.11.2015

Version updates and fixes:

* First release of CVSandbox Virtual Camera. It creates a DirectShow compatible
  virtual camera in the system, which by default produces black and white pixels.
  However, images into it can be fed by "Virtual Camera Push" plug-in for
  Computer Vision Sandbox. Original images can come from any video source,
  then processed by different image processing filters and finally pushed into
  the virtual camera, which then can be used from any application supporting
  DirectShow video sources (like Skype, for example).
