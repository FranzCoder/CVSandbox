* The first release of the plug-ins' module for Computer Vision Sandbox.
  It provides "Image Folder Video Source" plug-in, which is an improved version of "JPEG Folder Video Source"
  plug-in. The old plug-in was taken from "vs_mjpeg" module and extended to support both JPEG and PNG images.

  Also it provides a new "Image Folder Writer" plug-in, which writes images into the specified folder at the
  specified time intervals (supports JPEG and PNG codec). This may allow creating time lapse images, for example.
