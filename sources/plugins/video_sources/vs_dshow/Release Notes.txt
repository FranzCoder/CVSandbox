DirectShow Video Sources 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------
03.08.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Allow overriding frame rate of Local Capture Device video source plug-in, if those support range of frame
  rates for the selected video resolution. Although it is now supported, don't expect every possible frame
  rate to work. First, the are funny cameras/drivers. Second, the DirectShow API to get supported frame rates
  has certain limitations. For example, some drivers may claim they support frame rates in the [1-30] range
  and they really respect it - they can provide images at the rate set. Other cameras, may claim they support
  frame rates in the [15-30] range, but they will only work either at 15 or 30 rate, nothing in between.
  And there are other drivers, which say they can do up to 100 frames a second, but they can never do anything
  more than 30.
* Added run time properties for Local Capture Device video source plug-in, which allow changing camera's
  properties like brightness, contrast, saturation, etc. (if the camera driver supports those properties).



DirectShow Video Sources 1.0.1

  those anyway for now.
