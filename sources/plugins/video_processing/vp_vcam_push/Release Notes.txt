CVSandbox Virtual Camera Push Plug-in 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------
03.08.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Updated the push plug-in to support 1.1.0 version of CVSandbox Virtual Camera, which now
  supports multiple resolutions. The push plug-in only does color conversion if necessary, but
  leaves any required resizing to the virtual camera. Images larger than 2000x1500 are rejected.
