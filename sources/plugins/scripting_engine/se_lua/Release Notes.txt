Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.6
-------------------------------------------
23.12.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # API revision (SCRIPTING_API_REVISION variable) is raised to 7.
  # Added support for Point plug-in property type with real numbers.
  # Fixed setting of negative integers from script into the running host (Host.SetVariable()).



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.5
-------------------------------------------
03.08.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # API revision (SCRIPTING_API_REVISION variable) is raised to 6.
  # Added Host::GetVideoSource() API, which allows getting object of the video source for
    which a script is running. This allows changing run time properties of a video source
    from the script, which is set to perform image processing for the video source.



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.4
-------------------------------------------
07.03.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # API revision (SCRIPTING_API_REVISION variable) is raised to 5.
  # Added support for plug-in's properties of 2D array type. Those are represented as "jagged table"
    in Lua - table of tables, where all sub-tables must be of the same length.



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.3
-------------------------------------------
13.10.2016

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # API revision (SCRIPTING_API_REVISION variable) is raised to 4.
  # The scripting engine is changed to avoid implicit conversion of floating point numbers to
    integers. If a plug-in's property or function expects an integer value, then such must be provided.
    It is user's responsibility to use math.floor() when needed.



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------
03.07.2016

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # API revision (SCRIPTING_API_REVISION variable) is raised to 3.
  # Added support for array type properties. Plug-in API allow as getting/setting entire array using
    GetProperty( propertyName ) and SetProperty( propertyName, value ), as getting/setting individual
    values using GetProperty( propertyName, index ) and SetProperty( propertyName, index, value ).
  # Added support for point and size property types, which are represented as Lua arrays with 2 values.
  # Added APIs to store variables at host side:
    Host.GetVariable( variableName ) and Host.SetVariable( variableName, value ). The APIs allow
    storing variables of Lua scalar types, arrays (not tables with arbitrary indexing) and image objects.
  # Extended plug-in's interface with new CallFunction() API, which allows calling arbitrary functions
    exposed by a plug-in.
  # Added support for image processing plug-ins. Unlike image processing filter plug-in, this new type is
    for image processing routines which don't change image at all. Only for processing images with the aim
    to calculate some values, which are then accessible as read-only properties.
  # Added support for 2 source image processing filter plug-ins. These plug-ins operate with two image to
    perform their task. For example, adding images, subtracting images, intersection (min), merge (max), etc.
  # Fixed error reporting when using ExportImage() method of image exporting plug-ins.
  # Fixed Lua scripting engine, which was badly creating instances of some plug-ins, causing crashes on various
    APIs for different plug-in types: IsPixelFormatSupported(), GetOutputPixelFormat(), GetSecondImageSupportedSize(),
    GetSecondImageSupportedFormat(), SupportedExtensions(), SupportedPixelFormats().

* Lua Scripting plug-in fixes:
  # Updated plug-in to support variables storage at host.
  # Updated plug-in's description, so it tells about latest added APIs and new plug-in types' interfaces.



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------
19.02.2016

Version updates and fixes:

* Scripting engine fixes:
  # Added SCRIPTING_API_REVISION global variable, which reports API revision, so scripts could check it
    and raise an error if API revision does not match expectations. Current API revision is set to 2.
  # New APIs added:
    - Image:Clone() - clones an images.
    - Image:GetSubImage() - gets sub image of the specified size.
    - Image:PutImage() - puts an image into the specified image at the specified location.
    - Image:Release() - releases reference to the image, so it can be disposed.
    - Image:Release() - releases reference to the plug-in, so it can be disposed.
  # Added check for number of parameters to all exposed APIs - calls will fail if number of passed
    parameters is not equal to expected value.
  # Extended the list of registered Lua libraries to: table, math, os, string, io, bit32.


* Lua Scripting plug-in fixes:
  # Added property which allows controlling frequency of forced Garbage Collection cycles.
  # Documented API of Image Importing and Image Exporting plug-ins.
  # Documented Host.Name() and Host.Version() APIs.
  # Applied fix to Lua library, so it is possible to load scripts from folders containing
    Unicode characters.



Lua Scripting Engine 1.0.0 
-------------------------------------------
27.11.2015

* The first release of the plug-ins' module for Computer Vision Sandbox.
