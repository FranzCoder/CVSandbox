Blobs' Processing 1.0.4
-------------------------------------------
23.12.2018

* Added "Filter Circle Blobs" plug-in, which allows keeping objects having circle shape and remove
  anything else. It does allow filtering by size - minimum/maximum radius. For each found circle,
  its center and radius are provided.

* Added "Filter Quadrilateral Blobs" plug-in, which allows keeping objects having quadrilateral shape
  (having 4 corners) and remove anything else. It does provide setting to look for rectangles or
  squares. For each found quadrilateral, coordinates of its corners are provided.

* Deprecated the "Find Blobs By Size" plug-in. "Filter Blobs By Size" plug-in must be used instead,
  specifying it needs only to find blobs, not do the actual filtering.



Blobs' Processing 1.0.3
-------------------------------------------
11.10.2017

* Fixed core blob processing routine, so it does not disjoin parts of a single object due to broken
  labelling algorithm.



Blobs' Processing 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------
07.03.2017

* Fixed core blob processing routine, which could stuck in an endless loop on certain images.



Blobs' Processing 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------
13.10.2016

* Updated "Find Biggest Blob" plug-in, so it allows also searching for background areas (holes) as well.
  This allows to find the biggest background area, which is not touching image edges (a hole in an object).
  Previously it would be required to invert objects' image for that.
* Added "Find Blobs By Size" plug-in, which is similar to "Filter Blobs By Size", but does only blobs' searching
  (image is not changed).



Blobs' Processing 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------
03.07.2016

* The first release of the plug-ins' module for Computer Vision Sandbox.
  It provides the next plug-ins:
  # "Keep Biggest Blob" - Keeps only the biggest blob in the image while removing the rest.
  # "Find Biggest Blob" - Finds the biggest blob in the image. Similar to the above, but this plug-in
    does not do any changes to the provided image - only finds coordinates of the biggest blob.
  # "Filter Blobs By Size" - Keeps only the blobs within the specified size limits.
  # "Fill Holes" - Fills holes in objects found in the specified image.
