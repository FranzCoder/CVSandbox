Standard Image Processing 1.0.9
-------------------------------------------
19.03.2019

Version updates and fixes:

* Added "Cut Image" plug-in, which allows cutting sub-image out of the source image.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.8
-------------------------------------------
23.12.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Added "Objects Thinning" plug-in, which makes objects thinner by removing specified amount of their edges.
  The idea is similar to "Erosion" morphology operator, however objects thinning plug-in operates on
  distance transformation and so its performance does not depend on the thinning amount.
* Added "Objects Thickening" plug-in, which grows objects by the specified amount. Idea is similar to
  "Dilatation" morphology, but implemented using distance transformation.
* Added "Objects Edges" plug-in, which uses distance transformation in order to keep specified amount of
  objects' edge pixels.
* Added "Objects Outline" plug-in, which uses distance transformation in order to create outline of objects.
  It is similar to "Objects Edges", but outline is around object, not part of it.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.7
-------------------------------------------
11.10.2017

Version updates and fixes:

* Minor performance improvements by using SSE instructions for Grayscale, Threshold and
  Otsu Threshold plug-ins.
* Fixed edge hysteresis in Canny Edged Detector plug-in, so it uses temporary edge image while
  calculating final edges.
* Added Erode Edges plug-in, which can be used to remove horizontal/vertical lines.
* Added Run Length Smoothing plug-in to fill horizontal/vertical gaps between objects.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.6
-------------------------------------------
07.03.2017.

Version updates and fixes:

* Added "Morphology Operator" plug-in, which allows to perform Erosion, Dilatation, Opening, Closing,
  Top Hat and Bottom Hat operators, using custom specified structuring element.
* Added "Hit and Miss" plug-in, which provides the hit-and-miss morphology operator.
* Added "Convolution" plug-in, which allows to perform image convolution using custom specified kernel.
* Added "Gaussian Blur" and "Gaussian Sharpen" plug-ins to perform image blurring/sharpening using
  Gaussian kernel of the specified size and standard deviation.
* Renamed "Difference Edge Detector" plug-in into "Edge Detector". It now provides few different edge
  detection modes: Difference, Homogeneity and Sobel.
* Added "Canny Edge Detector" plug-in, which does edge detection using the Canny algorithm.
* Added "Gray World Normalization" plug-in, which does image color normalization using the Gray World
  algorithm.
* Added "Mean Shift" image processing filter plug-in, which calculates mean value of pixels in a window
  of the specified size, but taking only pixels which satisfy the specified color distance criteria.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.5
-------------------------------------------
13.10.2016.

Version updates and fixes:

* Updated "Mask Image" plug-in, so it provides two modes of masking: fill source image when mask values
  are zeros or fill it when non-zeros. If a mask image is aimed to separate objects from background,
  for example, then both parts (objects and background) can be extracted using the same mask (no longer
  required to invert it).
* Added "Color Channels Filter" plug-in, which performs filtering of RGB channels.
* Added "HSL Color Filter" plug-in, which filters pixels in HSL color space.
* Added "HSV Color Filter" plug-in, which does pixels' filtering in HSV color space.
* Added "Distance Color Filter" plug-in, which does Euclidean and Manhattan distance color filtering.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.4
-------------------------------------------
03.07.2016.

Version updates and fixes:

* Added "Shift Image" plug-in, which allows shifting images by the specified number of pixels.
* Added "Extract Quadrilateral" plug-in, which allows extraction quadrilateral image specified by
  coordinates of 4 corners from a source image.
* Added "Embed Quadrilateral" plug-in, which allows putting specified image into quadrilateral of
  the target image.
* Added "Image Statistics" plug-in, which allows calculating RGB histograms for color images and
  intensity histogram for grayscale images. Also calculates statistical values like Minimum, Maximum,
  Mean and Standard Deviation.
* Enabled and described "Level Linear" an "Level Linear Grayscale" plug-ins, which allow performing
  linear correction of RGB channels for color images and intensities for grayscale image.
* Enabled and described next two source image processing filter plug-ins: "Add Images", "Subtract Images",
  "Intersect Images" (minimum of two images), "Merge Images" (maximum of two images).
* Enabled and described "Diff Images" two source image processing filter plug-in, which calculates
  absolute difference between two images.
* Added "Diff Images Thresholded" two source image processing filter plug-in, which calculates thresholded
  absolute difference between two images.
* Enabled and described "Extract RGB Channel" and "Extract nRGB Channel" plug-ins, which extract specified
  RGB/nRGB channel from a color image and provide it as a grayscale image.
* Added "Replace RGB Channel" plug-in, which allows replacing specified RGB channel with a specified
  grayscale image.
* Added "Mask Image" plug-in, which sets pixels of a source image to the specified fill color if corresponding
  pixels of a mask image are equal to 0.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.3
-------------------------------------------
19.02.2016.

Version updates and fixes:

* Enabled and documented "Grayscale To RGB" ("GrayscaleToRgb" for scripting) plug-in.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------
27.11.2015.

Version updates and fixes:

* Added Rotate Image plug-in, which rotates an image by the specified angle.



Standard Image Processing 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------
28.09.2015.

Version updates and fixes:
* Renamed Gamma Correction plug-in to Brightness Correction, so it better reflects what it does.
* Reworked both Brightness and Contrast correction plug-ins, so they have single "factor" property,
  which allows both to increase and decrease brightness/contrast depending on its value's sign (the
  "inverse" property was removed).



Standard Image Processing 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------
06.07.2015.

* The first release of the plug-ins' module for Computer Vision Sandbox.
