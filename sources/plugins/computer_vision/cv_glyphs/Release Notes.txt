Glyphs Recognition and Tracking 1.0.0 
-------------------------------------------
23.12.2017

* The first release of the plug-ins' module for Computer Vision Sandbox.
  The module for now contains only one plug-in, which detects square binary
  glyphs in images (Glyph Detector). It does provide code string for each
  detected glyph, so some recognition logic can be done via scripting.
